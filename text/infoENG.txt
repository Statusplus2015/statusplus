Learning a language in a group can offer several advantages for both kids and adults, such as:

Social interaction: Learning in a group provides opportunities for social interaction with peers, which can make the language learning process more enjoyable and engaging.

Active learning: Group activities and discussions can encourage active learning and help learners to practice their language skills in a supportive environment.

Motivation: Being part of a group can provide motivation and accountability, as learners are able to see their progress compared to their peers and may feel more motivated to keep up with the pace of the class.
